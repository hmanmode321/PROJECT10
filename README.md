Custom-Object Character Recognition(OCR) on AWS (Google Drive/ Cloud Storage)
Build a Custom OCR by combining YOLO and Tesseract, to read the specific contents of a Lab Report and convert it into an editable file. Use YOLO_V3 to trained on the personal dataset. Then the coordinates of the detected objects are passed for cropping the detected objects and storing them in another list. This list is passed through the Tesseract to get the desired output
